# GestureB - AI-Powered Sign Language Learning Platform

An interactive web application that uses computer vision and deep learning to teach American Sign Language (ASL) through real-time gesture recognition and feedback.

## üéØ Overview

GestureB combines modern web technologies with advanced machine learning to create an immersive sign language learning experience. Users can practice ASL gestures, receive instant AI feedback, and track their progress through an intuitive interface.

### Data Flow
1. **Video Capture**: Frontend captures user gestures via webcam
2. **Frame Processing**: MediaPipe extracts hand landmarks from video frames
3. **Feature Engineering**: Landmarks normalized and formatted for ML model
4. **Prediction**: LSTM model processes temporal sequence for gesture classification
5. **Feedback**: Real-time results sent back to frontend with confidence scores
